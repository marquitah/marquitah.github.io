This was my first professional portfolio.

It has gone through many transformations over the last few months. When it was in use, I kept it up-to-date with projects and newly learned skills. I used GitHub to host the site.

I wanted a really clean design with smooth features so I chose to use a Bootstrap template. As my skills as a developer grow, I can look back on this & remember where I was at that point in time.

I decided to completely revamp my portfolio because I feel that this one did not portray my projects in a very interesting and engaging way for the user. 

Thanks for taking a look!
